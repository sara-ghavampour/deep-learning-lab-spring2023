. [MNIST MLP Classification](mnist-mlp-classification): Investigaing the effects of different properties of MLP such as number of layers, number on neurons in each layer and optimizer on accuracy.

. [Transfer Learning](transfer-learning): Pretrain ResNet, DenseNet and VGG on Dog&Cat dataset ,and conduct experiments on different percentages
of freezing layers in the fine-tuning satge.

. [Sentiment classification](sentiment-classification): Sentiment classification on Sports and Outdoors Amazon comments dataset, and conducting experiments by using  SimpleRNN  ,LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional RNN for layers.

. [Unsupervised Deep Learning](unsupervised-deep-learning): Train CNN-AE and DCGAN on CIFAR10 and DomainNet datasets, and investigate the properties of these unsupervised neural networks by testing them on unseen data.
